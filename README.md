# PLP Bookstore - MongoDB Fundamentals Assignment

This repository contains the implementation of the MongoDB Fundamentals assignment as part of the PLP MERN Stack Development course.

---

## üìö Project Overview

This project involves setting up a MongoDB database for a bookstore, performing CRUD operations, advanced queries, aggregation pipelines, and indexing to optimize performance.

---

## üöÄ Features Implemented

- Created a MongoDB database called `plp_bookstore` and a collection named `books`
- Inserted sample book documents with fields such as `title`, `author`, `genre`, `published_year`, `price`, `in_stock`, `pages`, and `publisher`
- Performed basic CRUD operations (find, update, delete)
- Executed advanced queries including filtering, projection, sorting, pagination
- Built aggregation pipelines to analyze data (average price by genre, author with most books, grouping by publication decade)
- Created indexes on key fields to optimize query performance
